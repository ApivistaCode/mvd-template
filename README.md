# Minimum viable documentation (MVD) template for API docs

This is a fill-in-the-blanks template for minimum API documentation. Replace all of the [prompts in brackets] with content that's specific to your API. When you've replaced all the bracketed prompts, you'll have the essentials documented sufficiently to help people use your API.

If something in this template doesn't make sense for your API, delete it! And likewise, add any sections you need based on your API's particulars. We hope our suggestions in this template will spark more ideas about documenting features of your API to help users consume it.

Most content is written in Markdown, although the homepage is written in HTML. The template itself is a Jekyll site that you can use with gh-pages. If you want to run your docs on gh-pages, here's a guide by Jonathan McGlone to help you get set up: [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
